These tools are intended to help implementation team members, Aras Practitioners, export, diff and import Aras PackageDefinition and support both manual and automated source control processes, following these steps:
	1. Determine what changes have been made in a dev database that need to be shared with others
	2. Export the changed Items
	3. Create packages that can be tested, validated and deployed to production, with the least effort
	4. Save and merge changes with whatever source control process the team is using

The tools use same libs.dll assembly used by the Aras Solutions Upgrade tools. Third party tool such as BeyondCompare or DiffDog is required for diffing. Third party Open Source tools are required for Data Model Diagram (GraphViz.org) and Zipping exported folders (dotnetzip.codeplex.com), you need to download and install these and will become the licencee.
